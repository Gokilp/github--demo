# Introduction of programming

# Types programming Lanuage

- procedural programing Lanuage
- Functional programing Lanuage
- Object oriented programming Lanuage

# procedural programing Lanuage

- spcifices a series of well structured steps and procdurces to compose a program
- contains  a systematic order of staments,functions and commands to complete a task

# Functional programing Lanuage

- writing a progam only in pure function never modify variable,but onyl create new ones as an Output
- used in  situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data like ml. frist class function

# Object oriented programming Lanuage

Revloves around objects 

code + data = object 

Method+ properties = object 

Developed to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse and maintain software

# Static vs Dynamic programming Lanuage

|     static programming Language  | Dynamic programming Language  |
| --- | --- |
| perform type checking at complie time | perform type checking at runtime  |
| Error will show at compile time  | Error will not show till  at program run |
| Declare data type before you use it | no need to declare datatype of variable  |
| more control  | save time in writing code but might give  error at runtime |

# Garbage collection

- Garbage collection is object with  no refernce objects
- dynamic progamming usage on Referenece variable and object
