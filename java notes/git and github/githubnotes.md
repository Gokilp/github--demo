Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a software development practice that helps software teams manage changes to source code over time.3 It records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.1 Version control is a component of software configuration management and is closely related to source code management.0 It tracks the progress of code across the software development lifecycle and its multiple iterations, maintaining a record of every change complete with authorship, timestamp, and other details.2 Version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter as development environments have accelerated.3
